## ü§ñ My AI Usage

I utilized various AI tools to enhance my development workflow and improve the quality of the project.

### Tools Used

  * **GitHub Copilot:** For autocompleting code, generating boilerplate, and suggesting implementations for functions.
  * **ChatGPT:** To brainstorm component structures, debug complex issues, and generate documentation.
  * **Gemini:** For refining API logic, improving user experience, and creating professional documentation like this README.

### How I Used Them

  * I used **GitHub Copilot** extensively within my IDE to speed up the creation of React components, utility functions, and API service files. It was particularly helpful for writing repetitive code like form handling and state management logic.
  * I turned to **ChatGPT** when I encountered challenging bugs or needed to explore different approaches for implementing features like filtering and searching on the dashboard. It also helped in writing clear and concise error messages for the UI.
  * I leveraged **Gemini** to structure the overall project, design the API interactions in `src/lib/api.ts`, and generate a polished and professional `README.md` file that effectively communicates the project's features and setup.

### Reflection


AI tools were instrumental in accelerating the development process and allowing me to focus more on high-level architecture and user experience. They served as a powerful pair-programming partner, offering suggestions and solutions that I could adapt and integrate into the project. While AI provided a significant boost in productivity, I ensured that all generated code was thoroughly reviewed and tested to meet the project's quality standards.
